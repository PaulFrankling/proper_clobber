## Testing

### Validation

#### W3C Markup Validation Service

* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the project. Each page was validated by its URI and produced no errors or warnings. When each HTML page was validated by direct input, all errors produced were due to templating.
