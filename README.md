### Colour Scheme

[Coolor](https://coolors.co/ffffff-f5f5f5-7e7f83-000000-ceff1a) was used to create a colour scheme for the project:

* White `#FFFFFF`
* Cultured `#F5F5F5`
* Gray Web `#7E7F83`
* Black `#000000`
* Electric Lime `#CEFF1A`

### Typography

The primary font for the project is **Archivo** and the secondary font is **Montserrat**. 
Both fonts were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo?query=archivo#standard-styles).

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs

1. [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is the main high level Python web framework used to speed up the process of building this application.
1. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/) is used to form the layout of the website and make it responsive. It is also used to add components to the project.
1. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo?query=archivo#standard-styles) is used to implement the primary font of **Archivo** and the secondary font of **Montserrat**.
1. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is used to add icons to the website.
1. [Coolor](https://coolors.co/ffffff-000000-7e7f83-ceff1a) is used to develop a colour scheme for the project.
1. [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) is used to create and style a shortcut icon/favicon for the project.
1. [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) is used to compress the imagery memory size of the repository to help improve the speed of the website.
1. [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) is used to apply a colour change to certain elements on the page when hovered over with the mouse.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for version control. Code produced in the Gitpod terminal is committed and then pushed to GitHub.
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is used to store the project code pushed from Git.

## Testing:

## Deployment:

* This project repository was created on [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the Code Institute Gitpod Template.

* Once the repository was created, the process of building my project started by clicking the green 'Gitpod' button above the repositories folders and files.

* Once the workspace loaded, I used the CLI(Command Line Interface) to create the relevant folders and files to start applying code to the project.

* My changes were continually added, committed and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/) in the CLI. The commands inputted were as follows:

    `git add <filename>`

    `git commit -m "descriptive commit message"`

    `git push`

### Making a local clone

To run this project locally, you need to follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Proper Clobber repository](https://github.com/PaulFrankling/proper_clobber).
1. Above the repositories folders and files, click the 'Code' button.
1. In the 'HTTP' section, copy the URL shown.
1. Next, open **Git Bash**.
1. By using the `cd` command, change to the current working directory you want the cloned repository to be made.
1. Input `git clone` into the terminal and add the URL copied from step 3, then press enter.
1. Your local clone will now be created.
